I found a dataset named "Happiness Index 2018-2019". Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sougatapramanick/happiness-index-2018-2019
Since I am planning to pursue medicine, I wanted to observe the relationship between health and happiness score. 
For my own curiousity, I seperated out the dataset into subsets of 2018 and 2019 to observe that both years had similar relationships between health and happiness. 
The video is the mp4 file attached separately (sorry for my coarse voice! I had a cough).
